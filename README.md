# VTT Talk Percentage Analyzer

Welcome to the VTT Talk Percentage Analyzer, a simple, browser-based tool designed to analyze and display the percentage of time each speaker talks in a VTT (Web Video Text Tracks) file. This tool is perfect for meetings, webinars, and any event recordings where multiple speakers are involved and you're curious about the distribution of speaking time.

## How to Use

To use the VTT Talk Percentage Analyzer, follow these simple steps:

1. Visit [https://wreiske.github.io/vtt-talk-percentage/](https://wreiske.github.io/vtt-talk-percentage/).
2. Click on the **Upload VTT File** button to select your VTT file.
3. Click on the **Analyze** button to process the file.
4. The results will be displayed under the **Analyze** button, showing the percentage of the meeting each speaker occupied.

## Features

- **No Server Processing**: Your VTT files are processed locally in your browser, ensuring privacy and quick results.
- **Easy to Use**: A straightforward interface allows for hassle-free operation.
- **Detailed Analysis**: Get precise percentages of speaking time for each speaker identified in the VTT file.

## How It Works

The VTT Talk Percentage Analyzer reads the uploaded VTT file and utilizes JavaScript regex to parse speaker segments. It calculates the total speaking duration for each speaker and then computes the percentage of the total time each speaker talks. The analysis happens entirely within your browser, ensuring your data's privacy and security.
