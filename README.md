# VTT Talk Percentage Analyzer

Welcome to the VTT Talk Percentage Analyzer, a simple, browser-based tool designed to analyze and display the percentage of time each speaker talks in a VTT (Web Video Text Tracks) file. This tool is perfect for meetings, webinars, and any event recordings where multiple speakers are involved and you're curious about the distribution of speaking time.

2. Click on the **Upload VTT File** button to select your VTT file.
3. Click on the **Analyze** button to process the file.

The analysis happens entirely within your browser, ensuring your data's privacy and security.
